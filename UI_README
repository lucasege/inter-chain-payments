Goal: show off that using L1 liquidity we can perform some actions on L2 and borrow liquidity from L1 securely

The idea would be to show some purpose for using the L2 and utilizing l1 liquidity. Purposes for L2s today largely seem to be financial, e.g.:
1. GMX - perps
2. NFTs
3. Swaps -- not a good demo

Basic design:
1. Connect via metamask -- fund a vault contract (SourceAccount) on eth (goerli) with ~0.1 gETH
2. Also create a SCW account on Arb goerli (ReceiverAccount)
3. Global entrypoint + InterChainPaymaster
4. Show an NFT for sale on Arb (simple sale contract requires 0.1ETH to mint the NFT)
5. Account on L2 has 0 ETH
6. Create and sign intent to buy NFT with L1 liquidity, send this to paymaster, the paymaster will then verify your claim
7. Intent is frontrun and processed on L2
8. Paymaster refunds itself

Extension:
1. Build a metamask snap to show the intent with a clean signing UI that would show a PoC of this working
2. Bridge assets between Eth and COsmos app-chains? Stargaze NFTs
